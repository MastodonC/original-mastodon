# Project Mastodon

*Don't let your cloud computing become hairy, lumbering, and extinct.*

This is the remains of the original Mastodon C idea (and some later
tweaks) from the London Green Hackaton in January of 2012.

The code doesn't work any more. I'd do a fair bit very differently if
I was to do it again, but it was a fun weekend and we got a company
out of it.

There are some CO2 calculations in here that may or may not be
correct, but were done to the best of our ability on the weekend with
a lot of very good support from AMEE. All errors in analysis are
ours. The advice we received was excellent.

The Mastodon participants that weekend were Francine Bennett, Jane
Dickson and Bruce Durling.

The video of our first presentation is here: http://london.greenhackathon.com/hacks/mastodon/

We won Best Hack and the peoplefund.it prize and had a great time.

I still think MickeyG is a great unit of measurement.

I also completely misunderstood how AWS S3 worked at the time.

Don't use it. Maybe read it for a laugh or to see a bit of history.
